# Telecom Recharge & Usage Behavior Analysis 🚀

This repository contains a data science project that analyzes prepaid telecom recharge and customer usage behavior. It demonstrates data joining, revenue analysis, customer ranking, and exploratory data visualization using a scalable, production-quality workflow.

## 📊 Project Summary

The project uses simulated large-scale telecom data to:

✅ Merge recharge data, customer usage, and demographic profiles  
✅ Calculate ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)  
✅ Identify the top 5 highest-value customers by recharge activity  
✅ Analyze data, voice, and SMS usage patterns by city  
✅ Visualize recharge distributions and usage patterns
